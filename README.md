# R4OS Kernel

This repository contains the x86_64 R4OS kernel, Limine boot integration,
required built-in facilities, and kernel-specific tests. The kernel consumes
the separate platform Contract and does not define optional Runtime-R4L APIs.

## Build and validation

On Windows:

    Build.bat test

On Linux or macOS:

    ./Build.sh test

`Settings.R4S` maps the Contract, DevKit, and artifact paths. The kernel
build is ReleaseSafe and does not enable SIMD.

The platform exposes a continuous nanosecond clock independently from the
periodic PIT, HPET, or LAPIC scheduler event source. Exact invariant-TSC and
free-running HPET sources are preferred; hardware without either capability
uses an explicitly degraded periodic fallback.

Detailed German migration notes are preserved in
`DOCUMENTATION.de.txt`.
